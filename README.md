## 1. Hackerearth-ML challanges
#### Dataset

The dataset consists of parameters such as: a unique ID assigned to each animal that is up for adoption, date on which they arrived at the shelter, their physical attributes such as color, length and height, anonymous feature X1, X2 and other factors.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:
* This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that classify images into multiple categories
* This challenge will help you to actively enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning

## Approach

* Trained model by applying various ML algorithms like **SVC, Random-forest, Decision tree, XGboost, ANN** and many more.
* Worked with various **hyperparameter tuning techniques** like: 
<br>

1. **OPTUNA**,  An open source hyperparameter optimization framework to automate hyperparameter search.<br>

2.  **GENETIC ALGO. like TPOT**,  TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. <br>


3. **Random/Grid Search techniques**


## Results
* Scored 88.89% in hackerearth challange where top performer scored 91.1%.
